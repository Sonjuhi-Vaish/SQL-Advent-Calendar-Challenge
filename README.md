# SQL-Advent-Calendar-Challenge

𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭
The objective of this challenge was to strengthen SQL fundamentals by applying them to real-world business scenarios rather than solving isolated, theoretical problems.

Over 24 consecutive days, I worked through one SQL challenge per day, each designed to mirror practical decision-making situations using realistic datasets. The focus was not just on getting correct results, but on choosing the right approach, exploring alternative query strategies, and improving query optimization, readability, and performance.

This challenge helped reinforce consistency, deepen problem-solving skills, and bridge the gap between SQL theory and real-world analytical thinking—making it a meaningful milestone in my SQL learning journey.
